# feat(census): FR-990 census of the 242 capabilities — which user each serves, whether anything uses it, keep or remove (30-capability pilot)

## What we wanted to know

This project (yamlgraph — a tool that runs AI pipelines defined in YAML files) keeps a list of 242 "capabilities" — features the software claims to have (`capabilities/CAP-*.yaml`). For each one: what kind of user does it serve, does anything in the codebase still use it, should it be kept or removed, and what is it worth. The existing checks prove every capability has a requirement and a test; they cannot say whether anyone uses it.

## What this PR adds

A small pipeline, `examples/demos/cap_journey_census/`, that runs over that list:

1. **Collect facts** (`extract.py`) — for each capability: its description, the first 40 lines of the request that created it, and a code search (`git grep`, code files only) for anything that references it or imports its modules. No AI involved in this step.
2. **Classify** (`prompts/judge_cap.yaml`) — an AI model (Anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5`, temperature 0) sorts each capability into one of ten user types (defined in `journeys.yaml`) and says keep / remove / already removed, citing one consumer from the collected facts.
3. **Check** (`tools.py`) — plain code validates the answer: if the model says "keep" but the cited consumer is not in the search results, the row is marked *contested*, not trusted. Quoted evidence must actually appear in the source text. Malformed answers become *failed* rows with the raw output kept; nothing is silently dropped.
4. **Hidden checks** (`canaries.yaml`) — six capabilities whose correct answers were written down before any run. Any miss marks the whole run failed (after the artifacts are written, so the rows can still be read).

## What a 30-capability trial found (three runs; all rows committed)

- Steps 1, 3 and 4 work: run 3 produced 30/30 valid rows and the checker caught three cases where the model named a consumer that does not exist.
- **Two capabilities have nothing in the codebase using them** — CAP-184 (novel_fandom duplicate-entity guard) and CAP-78 (fi_domain_crawl demo) — removal candidates for separate FRs. If the rate holds, roughly 10–20 of 242.
- **About half of the sample serves only this project's developers**, not a customer.
- **The user-type sorting is not reliable yet.** "Someone writing a graph" became a catch-all; told not to, the model moved the catch-all elsewhere. The two user types the business plan ranks highest (corpus auditing, compliance evidence) got zero rows — partly because the model was given category names without definitions.
- The "business value" sentences are restatements of the description; not usable for ranking.

Full findings with the raw rows they cite: `feature-requests/FR-990-cap-journey-census.md` (FR = feature request: this repo's written plan for a change, with the acceptance criteria it is judged against; FR-990 is this one), section *Raw Output Read* (the repo's name for "the author read the raw output before quoting any number"; it lists what was seen in each run).

## Where to look first

1. `feature-requests/FR-990-cap-journey-census.md` — the request, the findings, what remains.
2. `docs/2026-09-05-research-plan-cap-journey-census.md` — §11 plain account, §10 how it works, §12 the "outsider reader" spike that shaped this description.
3. `docs/census/cap-journey-pilot-2026-09-05-run3.md` — the run-3 ledger (matrix, dispositions, failed rows); `-run1`, `-run2` are the earlier runs the findings cite.
4. `examples/demos/cap_journey_census/tools.py` — the checking rules.

## How to run it

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD yamlgraph graph run examples/demos/cap_journey_census/graph.yaml \
  --var source="capabilities:ids=CAP-131,CAP-81,CAP-126" \
  --var provider=anthropic --var model=claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --var journey_ids="<the ten user-type names, copied from examples/demos/cap_journey_census/journeys.yaml>" \
  --var journeys_path=examples/demos/cap_journey_census/journeys.yaml \
  --var canaries_path="" --var output_path=tmp/cap-census/smoke.md --full
```

Runs locally only; nothing is wired into CI. Cost: ~6k tokens per capability on haiku — a 30-capability run is well under a dollar. Data sent to the provider is the capability description and request text already public in this repository.

## What is NOT in this PR — stated, not hidden

- **No automated tests for the checker (`tools.py`).** The FR's acceptance criterion for them ("unit tests for the checking rules: catalog, consumer, evidence, canary gate") is still open. This is a research instrument whose output is advisory; the tests are required before its `retire` rows drive any removal.
- No full run over 242; no comparison with the fast model that was agreed (`mercury-2`, Inception Labs' fast diffusion language model) — the classification has to be stabilised first. The five remaining fixes are listed in FR-990 under *Proposed Solution*: (1) give the model the ten category definitions, not just names; (2) a code rule that stops "someone writing a graph" being used as a catch-all; (3) treat core-runtime capabilities used by everything as cross-cutting rather than forcing one user type; (4) classify each code-search hit as import / call / graph reference / mere mention, and require a non-mention for "keep"; (5) fix one case where a capability's own example folder still counted as its consumer.
- Nothing is retired by this PR. Each removal candidate goes through its own feature request, judged separately; the repository owner decides whether to act on any recommendation. The list of the ten user types lives in `examples/demos/cap_journey_census/journeys.yaml`, one line each with a definition.

## Process notes

Graph and prompt were written through the repo's required process for graph files (`scripts/author.sh`: an agent authors the YAML from a committed brief in `feature-requests/authoring-briefs/`; direct edits to graph files are blocked by a hook), two revisions. Python was hand-written. Diaries: `docs/diary/2026-09-05-reflection-fr-990-*.md`, `docs/diary/diary-2026-09-05-the-recap-nobody-outside-could-read.md`. The first version of this description was a pasted commit message; a spike in which a model with no access to this repository read this description and listed what it could not understand (recorded in section 12 of the research plan linked above) produced 33 "I don't understand" items against it and this rewrite.
